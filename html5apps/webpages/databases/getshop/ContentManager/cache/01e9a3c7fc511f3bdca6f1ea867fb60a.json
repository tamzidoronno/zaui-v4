[{"content":"<h2><strong>EXTRA CLEANING<\/strong><\/h2><p>Fewer and fewer hotels have cleaning every day for guests staying over many days in order to reduce costs. If a hotel for example have cleaning every fifth day, this is not always enough for the guests. Instead of contacting the reception to book extra cleaning, the guests can do it instead on the PGA. When the extra cleaning has been paid, the cleaning list for the cleaning personnel will be updated, and show which rooms need extra cleaning on any given day.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","id":"pga_row3","gs_page_id":"pga","_id":69}]
