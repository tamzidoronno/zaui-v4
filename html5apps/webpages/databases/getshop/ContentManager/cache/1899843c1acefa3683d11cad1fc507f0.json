[{"content":"<h2>KEEP TRACK OF YOUR BOOKINGS<\/h2><p>GetShop is using \"SmartTables\" so you don't need to open many windows at the same time. This is to avoid the mouse-click-syndrome, keeping the mouse clicks to a minimum.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1. Smart state column<\/strong><br>The state column clearly indicates what state each booking is in, it could be unpaid, waiting for room to be cleaned, checked in, and so on. Also note that under the state icon you also see a text \"GDS, Exp (Expedia)\". This text indicates where the booking comes from.<br><br><strong>2. Quick filter<\/strong><br>Once you click on the icon (2) you get a list of quick filters for checking in. These are very handy when you quickly want to get an overview of who checks in today.<br><br><strong>3. Multi-purpose search field<\/strong><br>Enter any kind of information into this field to search; name, email, phone number, room number etc.. Once you hit search it has an optimised search algorithm to make the search as fast and accurate as possible.<br><br><strong>4. Advanced search<\/strong><br>When the simple but powerful search is not enough, you can use the advanced search feature. In this you can specify time intervals, state, when registered, when checking in and so on.<br><br><strong>5. Quick functions<\/strong><br>A lot of quick features have been added. This feature makes it possible to change the stay, pricing, room and room categories, and cancel the booking without opening the booking. This is very handy when handling large groups.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","id":"pms_bookings","gs_page_id":"pms","_id":52}]
