[{"content":"<h2>ACCESS CODES<\/h2><p>Much more than just a simple and easy pin-code<br><br><strong>How does automatic access codes work?<\/strong><br>When you use APAC (Automated Property Access Control) together with GetShop PMS the system is able to understand when a guest should have access to their room. Both systems speak with each other, so when a booking has expired the system will render the code useless.<br><br>The key to success is that our system does not only make a code based on the stay for the guest, but it also takes into consideration the cleaning status of the room and payment status of the booking. This is very important to keep in mind when you want to make the system as automated as possible. If you go for a PMS that does not have this feature and then connect a cloud based access controller you will not be able to fully automate the check-in and checkout process.<br><br>Once the system has valididated that this specific guest should have access, KaiPal will communicate with the guest trough SMS and Email, making it a 100% automated process.<br><br>The pin code size can be determined when ordering the system. We provide both 6 digits codes and 4 digits codes.<br><br><strong>Access log<\/strong><br>The locks give feedback to the booking system whenever a code has been entered. This enables you to keep track of which guests have accessed their rooms. It is important to note that a wireless network might have outages at some point and therefore we can not rely 100% on this. Because of that we are more recommending to use it as a guideline.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","id":"pms_accesscodes","gs_page_id":"pms","_id":56}]
