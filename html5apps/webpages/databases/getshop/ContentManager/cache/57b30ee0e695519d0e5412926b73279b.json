We quickly realized that creating a custom setup for each hotel took to much time and was a drain on our support team. That's when we decided to streamline the product into a PMS that was the same for everyone. A total rewrite was needed. The benefits was that set up time and time to market decreased rapidly, in increased support efficiency, and much easier to understand with much more feature for the hoteliers to utilize.<\/p><p><br>As a result, all GetShop products are stable, easy to set up to any online services and easy to integrate into any property.<\/p>","id":"about_us_row_5","gs_page_id":"aboutus","_id":39}]
