[{"content":"<h2>APAC - Automated Property Access Control<\/h2><p>The access control system plays a central role in hotel automation. When we first started our journey for hotel automation we had to overcome this obstacle. The access control system was one of the first things we needed solve. You cannot automate a hotel if you don't get rid of physical items like key or keycards. That is why we started looking at a keycode system that could be used for this purpose. After crawling the Internet for a good solution we ended up at this page. And that is because there were no good access control systems for hotel automation out there. We simply needed to build one ourselves.&nbsp;<\/p>","id":"products_apac","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":41},{"content":"<h2>LOCKS<\/h2><p>A wireless battery driven smart lock is essential for you success. A smart system needs to be able to communicate seamlessly with a smart lock.&nbsp;<br><br>We have created a smart lock system that does this for you and it is easy to install since it does not need any wiring. You can have up to 20 locks on each access controller and we also support multiple controllers connected to one system. This means we do not have any limits to how many locks you can operate in hotel, you can even have the multiple buildings in multiple cities.<\/p><p>Some of the key features:<\/p><ul><li>Z-wave Plus<\/li><li>Up to 100 meters wireless range (recommended maximum 4)<\/li><li>5 master codes \/ 25 guest codes<\/li><li>System key in case of electronic failure<\/li><li>Remote controller<\/li><li>Range extenders can be added to boost the signals<\/li><li>Can operate offline over a longer period of time which avoids your guest to run into trouble if your network is down.<\/li><\/ul><p>The lock we have here is specially modified by GetShop to support all the needs we have. It can also be delivered with different configurations like amount of codes, and also with a large data chip that supports even more codes.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_1","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":42},{"content":"<h2>GUEST CODES<\/h2><p>The code size is 4 to 6 digits, and this is predefined when ordering the APAC system. The system automatically generates random codes so it is always ready to be sent to any guest. If you have the APAC system integrated into GetShop PMS the code will not be sent out before the room has been paid for and cleaned. It will even prioritise clean rooms and make sure everyone are automatically assigned a room.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_2","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":43},{"content":"<h2>MASTER CODES<\/h2><p>The system has master codes that can be given to the janitors, cleaning staff and other operators. The master codes work for all the locks in the system. If a code gets lost to the public you can easily change them by the push of a button. The era for re-ordering keys and keycards are long gone.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_3","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":44},{"content":"<h2>USE APAC WITH OR WITHOUT PMS<\/h2><p>You decide yourself if you wish to use the APAC with the PMS or without it. It works great as a standalone cloud access control system too.<br><br><strong>Without PMS<\/strong><br>If you decide to not utilise the complete package you can do so by only setting up the automated cloud based access control system. When using it as a standalone system you will be able to manually send the codes by SMS and email to your guests. Once guests check out you simply delete them from the system and then they will be rendered usless.<br><br><strong>With PMS<\/strong><br>When using it with <a href=\"https:\/\/getshop.com\/property_management_system.html\">GetShop Property Management system<\/a> you will get a 100% automated system, where guests can book online, and also get a clean room automatically from the system, through an access control that is controlled directly from the PMS.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_4","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":45},{"content":"<h2>PHYSICAL KEYS<\/h2><p>You can decide when ordering locks if you want a unique key or a master key to go with it. The key is only used for maintenance in case of flat battery or technical issues. They are great to have when they are needed, but it is always recommended to use pin-codes for your guests.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_5","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":46},{"content":"<h2>ACCESS GROUPS<\/h2><p>During the setup of a new APAC you should think through your building entrance and layout. Our support team are happy to help you out here. What you need to keep in mind is that the guests probably need access to more than one door. This could be for instance the entrance door(s), the hotel rooms and maybe a gym, canteen, bathroom, lift, or even a gate of some kind.<br><br>By setting up access groups and then connect an access group to a hotel room you will be able to make a very dynamic layout of where guests should be allowed to go within your hotel.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_6","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":47},{"content":"<h2>ADVANCED&nbsp;ENTRANCE DOORS<\/h2><p>Next time you are looking for a new access control system, pay special attention to the entrance doors.
