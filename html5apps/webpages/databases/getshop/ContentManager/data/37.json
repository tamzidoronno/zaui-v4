{"content":"<h2>2016<\/h2><p>Birth of our own access control system<\/p><p>A second hotel joined us using our own lock system. The lock system we had used in the first hotel turned out to be too expensive and we needed to develop our own lock system. When searching for a suitable lock that where perfect for our need we found one lock and one lock only. The only lock we could communicate using a wireless communication protocol, that supported pin numbers, and could be opened no mather what from the inside. It was perfect for us! We ordered in one and convinced the hotel to go for it. Even years later they are using the same lock system. Also the hotel where in need of a common entrance system that could handle much more traffic and could be coded to have the same code system as for the hotel room doors, so we invented a control unit for this too.<\/p>","id":"about_us_row_3","gs_page_id":"aboutus","_id":37}
