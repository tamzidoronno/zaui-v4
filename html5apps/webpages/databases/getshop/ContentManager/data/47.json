What you need to keep in mind is that the guests probably need access to more than one door. This could be for instance the entrance door(s), the hotel rooms and maybe a gym, canteen, bathroom, lift, or even a gate of some kind.<br><br>By setting up access groups and then connect an access group to a hotel room you will be able to make a very dynamic layout of where guests should be allowed to go within your hotel.<\/p>","id":"products_apac_6","gs_page_id":"apac","_id":47}
