{"content":"<h2>ADD-ONS<\/h2><p>Our system has a powerful add-ons feature, yet it is very flexible and easy to use.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What can add-ons be used for?<\/strong><br>The most obvious feature of add-ons is adding \"Breakfast\" to a booking, but it can be used for so much more and it is a core function for automation. Assume a guest wants to order a \"Late Checkout\" through the PGA (Personal Guest Assistant). What actually happens is that the system checks whether it is possible for the guest to actually have the room for late checkout due to capacity. Once it is accepted it will be added as an add-on and the system automatically keeps track of whether the add-ons have been paid or not.<br><br>Add-ons can also be configured so that they can show up during the booking process for the guest, or configured so that they are only available to book for a certain category. This powerful feature gives you the flexibility you need to make campaigns etc. and earn extra money.<br><br>Add-ons can be configured to be repeating, per guest, or both. For example breakfast is a repeating add-on per guest. When changing the guest count the add-on will be changed accordingly. A deposit or late checkout is a non repeating add-on.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Add-ons from restaurant<\/strong><br>When using the SRS (Smart Restaurant System) you will be able to put things on the room, and therefore easily accessible when guests want to check out.<br><br><strong>Add-ons from point of sale<\/strong><br>Whenever you complete a tab in the point of sale you are given the option to transfer the add-ons to the room.<\/p>","id":"pms_addons","gs_page_id":"pms","_id":55}
