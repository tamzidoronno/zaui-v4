{"content":"<h2>What is a Channel Manager?<\/h2><p>What the channel manager does is keeping control of the availability in your hotel and keeps everything updated in all channels, minimising the risk for overbooking.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Assume you have 30 rooms in your hotel, and 28 rooms are occupied. Then you get a booking in from Booking.com. The channel manager will then update the availability so you have 1 room left to sell in all channels.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The channel manager also keeps track of cancellations, so you won't have to deal with that either.&nbsp;<\/p>","id":"channel_manager_row3","gs_page_id":"channelmanager","_id":64}
