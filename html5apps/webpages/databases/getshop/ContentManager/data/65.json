All discounts will automatically be deducted at the time of booking.<\/p><h3>Block OTA's from selling rooms<\/h3><p>Make sure the OTA's don't sell your rooms when you can sell them yourself. Add a restriction that sets the availble rooms to 0 at times when it is not nessesary.<\/p><h3>Min stay restriction<\/h3><p>At some days it might come in handy to restrict min stay to minimum 2 days. Do so by simply creating a restriction.<\/p><h3>Max stay restriction<\/h3><p>If you for some reason don't want guests to stay more than for example 10 days, simply create a restriction for that.<\/p><h3>Deny check in for a day<\/h3><p>Maybe you want to keep saturday open for guest staying from friday?
